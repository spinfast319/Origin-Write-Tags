# Origin Write Metadata
# author: hypermodified
# This python script loops through a directory opens the associated origin file, gets the meta data from that and writes it to the vorbis tags in the flac files in the directory
# This script writes to Album Artist, Album, Year, Label, Catalog Number for all albums.
# It will write to Artist as well if you specify that the albums are not Various Artists, DJ or Classical albums.
# This has only been tested to work with flac files.
# It can handle albums with artwork folders or multiple disc folders in them. It can also handle specials characters.
# It has been tested and works in both Ubuntu Linux and Windows 10.

# Before running this script install the dependencies
# pip install mutagen

# Import dependencies
import os  # Imports functionality that let's you interact with your operating system
import yaml  # Imports yaml
import shutil  # Imports functionality that lets you copy files and directory
import datetime  # Imports functionality that lets you make timestamps

#  Set your directories here
album_directory = "M:\PROCESS"  # Which directory do you want to start with?
log_directory = "M:\PROCESS-LOGS\Logs"  # Which directory do you want the log in?

# Set whether you are using nested folders or have all albums in one directory here
# If you have all your ablums in one music directory Music/Album_name then set this value to 1
# If you have all your albums nest in a Music/Artist/Album style of pattern set this value to 2
# The default is 1
album_depth = 1

# Set whether you are retagging albums that are various artist, dj, or normal
# Setting this to 1 will only set the Album Artist to the artist name which will be Various Artists
# Setting this to 2 will set the Album Artist tag to the DJ name
# Setting this to 3 will set both Album Artist and Artist tag to the artists name
# 1 = VA
# 2 = DJ
# 3 = Normal
# BE CAREFULL you could accidentally overwrite metadata that will be hard to get back if you have it set to 3
